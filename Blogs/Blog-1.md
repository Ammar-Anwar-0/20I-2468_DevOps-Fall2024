### **Overview**
This blog explores the fundamental differences between Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers, two cornerstone technologies in the field of DevOps. It provides insights into their use cases, performance implications, and how to decide between them for your application needs.

---

### **Key Highlights**
- **Virtual Machines**: Isolation at the hardware level, with each VM running its own OS.
- **Containers**: Lightweight, faster, and share the host OS kernel.
- **When to Use**:
  - VMs for hardware-specific requirements.
  - Containers for cloud-native and microservices-based applications.
- **Impact on DevOps**: How these technologies influence CI/CD pipelines and cloud cost optimization.
